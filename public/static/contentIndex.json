{"Anki/Getting-Started":{"title":"Getting Started","links":["Anki/Setup-Subscriber"],"tags":[],"content":"How to Use Anki: An Efficient Tutorial for Beginners\nWe’re going to cover ONLY the most essential elements of Anki that you should focus on, so you can:\n\nImmediately start using this awesome spaced repetition software\nAvoid the same mistakes that I did; and\nHave a roadmap that tells you what’s actually important when using Anki\n\nCapabilities of Anki\nIf you don’t know already, here are a couple of things Anki allows you to do in a nutshell:\n\nSchedule reviews automatically, so you don’t have to worry about which specific topic to study\nStudy 1714.29% more efficiently as compared to those using conventional flashcards\nStudy only what needs studying\nEncode information into long term memory at will, rather than by chance\nRemember almost anything you want without having to re-read\nStudy anywhere! Studying felt less effortful than ever the moment I started using Anki before. What a blessing.\n\nNow, this guide exists because I believe you just need to learn the few core info if you’re just looking to start.\nIt’s much like learning how to drive a car:\n\nYou don’t start driving a car by studying the ENTIRE manual. You only need to get better at using the ESSENTIAL controls to be able to start driving it.\n\nReal Talk: What is Anki? How does it work?\nAs you may know, Anki is an open-source flashcard app that uses spaced repetition algorithms to help you prevent natural forgetting.\nEven if you’re not born with awesome recall skills, Anki can help you to intentionally commit information into long-term memory.\nBut there’s a caveat.\nThat is, Anki works by supplementing your study process.\nAs good as it is, it’s NOT a magic pill nor a substitute for poor learning skills.\nWhy? Because Anki covers just the final one-third of the memory’s core processes for information encoding1 — which is retrieval.\nThis means that if the first two-thirds of the system you use for studying — encoding &amp; storage — is messed up, then using Anki won’t be the magic pill that it’s believed to be.\nIn contrast, when you do use Anki with the right process, you could gain tremendous advantage over the competition:\n\nYou basically guarantee that anything you study (again, using the right process) WILL get remembered for a long time\nYou build up a tall stack of prior knowledge that allows you to understand complex concepts quickly\nYou eliminate the most time-wasting study activity of all — “restudying what you’ve already studied because you forgot”\nYou can turn downtime into productive study time (when you use Anki while eating, for example, it allows you to practice 50 items in a breeze)\n\nBest of all, you get a tremendous long-term efficiency benefit:\nMichael Nielsen mentioned that in 20 years, he is 1714.29% (120 minutes/7 minutes * 100%) more efficient for each card when learning using spaced repetition compared to conventional flashcard learning.2\nSound good so far? I’m hearing questions…\n“Isn’t Anki just good for memorizing small facts?”\nContrary to popular belief, just because Anki is a flashcard app doesn’t mean it’s only used for memorizing words or raw facts.\nAs I imply in the last section, Anki is also a tool for LEARNING — which means it helps you establish a “library of mental models” for understanding higher-level concepts.\nI never skip Anki because in my mind, if I don’t retain all the prerequisite knowledge I’m required to remember, then it’d be hard for me to understand higher-level concepts in the future. (Ultimately, this causes even more wasted time.)\n“If Anki is so effective, then why do so many people fail at using it?”\nWhy do SO MANY people go into flashcard hell?\nGlad you asked. A few reasons why:\n\nThey use shared decks (most of which are ineffective). They keep trying to remember what they haven’t even learned yet. Learn before you memorize!\nThey have an unwieldy deck structure. Don’t create artificial knowledge barriers! As a rule of thumb, you should have one deck for each retrieval context. (exam, interview, language, field, etc.) NOT a deck for every section or topic of a book!\nIntermittent Reviews. They do Anki reviews intermittently—as if natural forgetting can be “skipped.”\nTheir thinking is stuck in Anki and ignore the other 2/3 of the learning process. They functionally fix themselves into Anki — they see it as “the entire system” when really, it’s really just “a small part of the engine”. Learning skills matter.\n\nNote: I’m well aware that you can use shared decks effectively for standardized exams, but I really don’t recommend it — UNLESS you’re in Medical School. I know of people who’ve created and used high-quality shared decks with great success, and you can find them here.\nThing is, most of these people who fail at using Anki treat is as a magic pill, instead of a tool that requires skill. (Woah, that rhymed…)\nAs Michael Nielsen put it in his essay:\n\nAnki is an extremely simple program […] Despite that simplicity, it’s an incredibly powerful tool. And, like many tools, it requires skill to use well. It’s worth thinking of Anki as a skill that can be developed to virtuoso levels, and attempting to continue to level up toward such virtuosity.\n\nCreating your first Anki cards\nTo create cards, just hit the “Add” on the top part of your window.\n\nBy clicking on it, you should be seeing the Add New window containing (1) Type, (2) Deck, (3) Front and Back fields, and (4) Tag field.\n\nNow, I wouldn’t worry about the “Fields…” and “Cards…” buttons just yet. They’re just card customizations that don’t make any difference at all to your recall.\nLike I said at the beginning of this guide, this is supposed to be about the essentials — and they’re just ain’t it.\nSo don’t even think that you need them.\nTrust me, you’ll get VERY FAR without even touching those things.\nNow, in the “Add New” window, the question goes in “Front” and the answer goes in “Back” field, just like your good ol’ paper flashcards.\n\nOnce you’ve entered your desired Question and Answer pair, you can click on “Add” or just use the shortcut “Ctrl + Enter” or “Cmd + Enter” to make the card.\n\nNote: Make sure to DOUBLE CHECK the “Deck” field before adding the card to prevent future headaches.\nBy the way, the card you’ve just seen is one of the “Basic” Card Types.\n\nYes, there are a few card types — but remember that the principle here is still to help yourself review information through recall.\nThe “Basic” card type allows you to perform the traditional flashcard studying — Question in front, Answer at the back.\nThe Cloze deletion, on the other hand, is a “fill-in-the-blank” type of card.\nThe others are self-explanatory based on their name.\nQuestion, foreseen: Which Anki card types are the best for learning?\nYES. The answer is yes…but I’ll explain.\nThe best card type is the one that has the best fit for the information you have learned.\nAnd guess what? The most flexible way to do that (without sacrificing the quality of learning) is by making Q&amp;A cards with a Basic card type.\nI’m speaking from experience, too: Cloze and reversed cards are hard to pull off unless you know how to create quality cards.\nSo my advice to you is to practice creating questions and answers first using a Basic card type. Only create Cloze cards for things that cannot be answered through recognition memory.\nIn short, start with only using Basic cards. Worry about the others once you can already make that work for you.\n\nOrganizing your cards\nLike I said earlier, I like to use Tags instead of subdecks.\nWhy tags? Because it simplifies everything. You need not worry about creating subdecks for each subject because you can use “Custom Study” more selectively later on.\nYou can add Tags to your cards in two ways:\n\nDuring Card Creation, or\nUsing the Card Browser\n\nI recommend adding Tags during Card Creation — it’s much faster and more proactive.\nTo add Tags during card creation, you just enter the name of your desired Tag on the “Tags” field of the Add New window.\n\nHere’s something to remember: Replace spaces with underscores.\nNote: If you missed that and accidentally entered two words separated by spaces, you’ll be creating TWO tags for your cards, not one.\nNow, creating that card, you should notice that the Tag name you entered in the Tags field did not go away.\nThis means you can create and create several cards without having to worry about putting Tags in every single time—that’s pretty handy.\nThe second method of adding tags is via the Card Browser. You open it up by clicking on “Browse” on the Home Screen or pressing “B” in the same place.\n\nHere’s how:\n\nClick on a deck where you can find the to-be-tagged cards\nSelect your cards on the right-hand side (you can select multiple)\nRight-click, then go to Notes &gt; Add Tags\n\n)\nI don’t prefer this method because it’s rather easy to mess this up.\nImagine accidentally adding tags to other cards when you already have a large collection of cards — just thinking about organizing it is already a disaster.\nBut, you do what you wanna do 🙂\nHere’s How I Make Anki Flashcards\nWhen you’re creating your cards, IMO the best way to create high-quality cards is to have these elements in place:\n\nA specific question\nA specific answer\nScreenshot of source\nTags (optional)\n\nYou should be good as long as you have those.\nTo demonstrate, I’ll be using a random book from the medical field (a field I don’t know anything about) just to demonstrate this process from a beginner standpoint.\nSo, when I see something on my book like this:\n\nThis card below is the one I make. I included the Question, Answer, Screenshot, and Tag.\n\nPRO TIP: You can add new lines to the “Back” field if you want to add more details such as mnemonics or screenshots.\nNotice that I italicized and bolded the word “previously” to show emphasis. It’s a way to make a cue for an answer more salient and easier to process.\nLet’s look at the card preview.\n\nLooks awesome!\nBy the way, I want to tell you that for dense conceptual subjects, I break each concept down into more questions that test my understanding.\nAnd this requires that I understand the thing FIRST.\nThis is the iron rule of effective card-making…\nLearn first before you memorize! (Rules #1 and #2 in the classic Twenty Rules of Formulating Knowledge)\nFacts are good to include as cards, for sure. But you have to encourage your understanding of the material — otherwise you’ll end up doing rote memorization. You’ll end up with a LOT of knowledge that you cannot even use.\nA pro tip from me:\nYou can also simulate situations that use the concept itself so you don’t miss out on actually applying what you have learned.\nSee this card, for example:\n)\nSee how that works?\nAlright, let’s move on to what you need to remember when creating new cards.\nTips for Creating Good Anki Flashcards\n1 – Learn FIRST, and THEN create flashcards from what you’ve learned\nJust like what I said a while ago, you gotta learn first before you make your cards.\nIf you’re just starting out, all you need to know is that the purpose of these flashcards is to test what you already learned.\nFolks, it’s “remember what you learn“, and not “learn what you remember“.\nIt’s easy to get confident that you can remember anything using Anki, but the truth is that NONE of that matters if you do not understand the material you’re putting in.\n(Unless you’re really memorizing isolated facts, but even so, context matters for retention)\nWell, what’s the worst that could happen when you don’t follow this rule?\nYou’ll know how to answer the flashcard but you’ll find out that you cannot apply the “knowledge” anywhere else.\nIn other words, you just get pseudoknowledge.\n2 – One simple card is worth 2x the vague cards\nDon’t try to put in paragraphs in a card.\nDon’t even try to put “Explain” type of questions.\nBreak them down until it’s simple FOR YOU.\nThis brings me to my next point.\n3 – The number of cards don’t matter much; coverage matters more\nThere’s no optimal number of cards.\nThink about what’s important here: It’s important that you have made cards that can cover the entire material you’ve understood.\nSo when adding cards, it doesn’t matter if you have plenty of cards just by studying a chapter as long as you follow the two rules above.\nWhat matters is you actually learn the concepts thoroughly.\nBreak a concept as much as possible.\nBy doing these two things, you’ll feel like you’re able to recall each card in less than a second. (Well, not physically less than a second, but that’s how it’ll feel like 😉)\nIt’s much, much faster compared to creating a few but long, complicated cards.\nFor example, instead of:\n“What are Newton’s Three Laws of Motion?”\nYou write questions like:\n\n“What is Newton’s First Law of Motion?”\n“What is Newton’s Third Law of Motion?”\n“Which law states F=ma?” (obviously, this question covers one law in another angle — also called redundancy)\n\nThis reduces ambiguity — making your cards faster to answer. Compare that to doing a mini-brain dump for each card and you’ll realize it gets tiresome pretty quickly.\nJust to be clear, there’s no stopping you from creating both types of cards.\nFeel free to experiment, because there really are times when a longer card can be more efficient. Let’s avoid black-and-white thinking here.\nStill not sure how to properly structure your flashcards?\nWell, in that case, I made a quick reference of examples just for you.\nThis quick reference will show you 13 flashcard examples and anti-examples so you can get started making good flashcards and avoid creating bad ones.\nSpecifically, you’re going to discover some of the most important lessons I’ve gained from manually creating 4000+ flashcards:\n\nYou can click the red button below to go to the signup page.\nHow to use Anki for studying anywhere (without feeling like you’re studying)\nHead over to Anki Sign Up and register for an account. It’s totally free. That’s why Damien Elmes is a hero.\nThen, after creating an account, press ‘Sync’ on your Anki’s home screen.\n\nA dialog box requiring your details will pop up.\nSimply enter the details you signed up for at AnkiWeb, and this will allow automatic syncing of your deck to the AnkiWeb servers—which allows you to sync your cards to ALL devices.\nIt’s pretty neat, especially if you’re going outside with your smartphone. (or when you’re sitting on the toilet — not exactly neat, tho)\nWhen you’re waiting in line, or just doing nothing at all, instead of scrolling through Facebook, you can answer 5 to 20 cards in a minute, depending on how good you create cards.\nThat means you’re converting idle time into STUDYING.\nIf that isn’t called studying smart, I don’t know what is.\nYou can turn it off and manually sync your cards by pressing Y on the home screen, but it’s always a good idea to sync your cards automatically upon open/exit just to avoid forgetting.\nSmash That Spacebar!\nStudying using Anki is pretty straightforward.\nYou just open the app, click a deck with due cards, and you’re set.\nWhen a card shows up, you just press on the spacebar to show the answer.\n\nWhen the answer shows up, you are given choices below to choose from: Again, Good, Easy.\nUsing Anki default settings, Anki will show the card again after a certain amount depending on how difficult it was for you to recall the card.\n\nAgain – Less than a minute, the card will show up again\nGood – The card will show up in less than 10 minutes\nEasy – The card will show up after 4 days\n\nMy method is simple:\n\nYou press Again when you failed to recall the answer,\nYou press Good when you successfully recall the answer\nYou press Easy when you meet two things: you already know the answer a long time ago, and you have recalled the answer in an instant\n\nYou can use Answer Button shortcuts as shown below:\n\nAs a side note for default settings, pressing “Again” on a mature card for a total of 8 times makes your card “disappear” and not show up for review.\nThis is called a “Leech card”, and is usually classified as a poorly created card.\nWhen you get Leech cards, all you have to do is reformulate your questions. Again, refer back to how I told you to create flashcards.\nAlright, now before I end this, I would like to give you some tips that would help you study smarter using Anki.\nWhy You Should NEVER Miss a Day of Review\nForgetting happens every single day. This means that poorly learned, seldomly used information are good as DELETED every single day.\nAnki works to combat this effect. (But again, follow my tip#1 when creating cards)\nAnother reason not to skip is you end up with a mountain of cards the next day. Yup, now you’ll have to review your overdue cards PLUS your due cards — that’s a hell of a review session to go through (trust me, I’ve been through 1500 cards in a day and I almost cried just doing that).\nSo, try do study every single day without fail.\nClosing Thoughts: Anki is a great tool for studying — but it’s not the ENTIRE study system\nAs powerful as Anki is, it’s just a tool that depends on your skills — and I want to make sure I drive that point home.\nThere’s always a sense of “wonder” in exploring new tools especially when it promises to solve our problems with having the lack of time.\nBut my advice, from experience, is to look at efficiency a different way:\nInstead of adding tools, think about eliminating wastes.\nThat’s the purpose of tools in the first place — to help us eliminate effort that isn’t adding any value or not leading us closer to our goal.\nAnki eliminates the non-value-adding activity called “scheduling your reviews and worrying about whether you need to review each item today or not.” (Yeah, that’s a mouthful)\nBut do NOT, by any means, expect that it’s a magic pill that will make you remember anything without skill and work ethic.\nWhat’s Next?\n\nDownload AnkiCollab addon 🌐 AnkiCollab\nSign up account on AnkiCollab and subscriber to your deck:\nSetup Subscriber to Your Personalized Deck\n"},"Anki/Setup-Subscriber":{"title":"Setup Subscriber","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Getting Started - Subscriber\nThe subscription key 🔑 is all you need!\nThe key will be a series of words separated by dashes.

Even though it’s on public domain :D\nTypically, I would jot down these reflections in my journal but for this occasion, to motivate you guys, to hopefully ignite a flame of undying passion for learning, I would like to share a snapshot of my life. First, one of my early mottos:\n\nMy thirst for knowledge will never be quenched.\n\nIf you don’t like it, then tough luck, take this as a reading task, and I’ve highlighted the vocabulary that you’ve learned, not the new ones.\nSo, to mark the commencement of our learning endeavor, here are your first tasks:\n\n\n                  \n                  This week&#039;s tasks \n                  \n                \n\n\n  First-level of recursion for new words on this reading task.\n Your comments/remarks (at least 3), send me personally or via group chat, suit you.\n Extra 2 points for those who note grammar structures used as well. An exhaustive one.\n\n\n\n⚠️Note  Minus 1 point for each vocabulary word you miss if asked. Missing means that you haven’t noted it yet.\nAutobiography\nPeople often tell me how “a normal person” would behave differently than I do, so I guess it’s only reasonable that my school life wasn’t typical either, lol.\nCompared to my peers, I didn’t study as much, playing most of the time and often doing the bare minimum or finding unconventional shortcuts to keep pace with them. But lucky me, the so-called “peers” were all geniuses, so I got put in place a lot. Even if I fooled around, the baseline level of effort to keep up helped me pass almost every important test entry.\nMy life has been the complete opposite and will probably become of this quote:\n\nYou either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\n\n\nWithout any intervention, wandering with perplexity and curiosity, I turned into a bad, but meticulous kid that no one seemed to notice.\n\n\nI believe the duality of one’s nature will always be present, but my poor decisions were taken lightly, or more accurately, went by unwares.\nI’m not proud, but thankfully, I could get back on the right track without much of a fight.\n\nPrimary School\nThis period was what I called “My Dark Era,” a time filled with confusion, all sort of emotions with no self-awareness, and restraint.\nI was a perfect role model student and a bully. I was too smart for my own good, excelling at anything I picked up so naturally I got things in my favor. People’s attention and praise probably took a heavy toll on me, but that was no excuse.\nMaybe subtle blame for uncontrollable primal instincts —aggression, violence, and the desperate need for validation and attention.😏\nNo need to delve further…\nSecondary School\nI called this period “The Storm After The Storm.” A got-away-with-it-somehow spoiled brat in the top class of the top school in my hometown.\nThe school wasn’t too far from my house, but it was still far enough for a spoiled kid to go on his own, and my parents couldn’t drop me off.\nTherefore, I got this uncalled-for luxury of going to school by taxi—yep, a taxi, with my neighborhood friends. Truly a story to be bragging about, for bourgeois families.\nThe academic life went south from here 😅 as the impulsive desires got the better of me. I skipped classes more than I skipped meals.\nI would told the driver to stop by the net on the way to school =))) and he would happily do so, since he was paid. Not my kid, not my problem 😂😂 Gotta respect that attitude though. Had a lot of fun and a lot of bad grades…\nI formed bonds with most of my closest friends here with the most unfiltered, raw, and rough version of myself, and the same goes for them. These low-maintenance relationships I believe will stay unstained, growing stronger yet unaffected by time and distance.\nWe were in the best, and also the wealthiest, class. We could go on weekend trips if any of the rich parents were happy that their kid scored a 10. A local prize would almost guarantee a trip, and a national one!? We’d have back-to-back class holidays! Without spending a dime.\nThis seemingly chill class turned out to have the highest unprecedented acceptance rate at Lam Son Gifted High School.\nI don’t think I’ll ever have as many extravagant extracurricular activities as I did back then. I got to see so much beauty and historical richness in Vietnam that I had always taken for granted.\nHigh School\nGetting into Lam Son has been my most significant cornerstone so far, though I didn’t realize it only until recently.\nIt’s not because of the school’s prestige or education (which, in and of itself, is remarkable) but because of the people here that changed me for the better, for good.\nMy typical day would start like this:\n\nI’d wake up late and rush to school, couldn’t make it on time, so I’d think, “screw it,” and go buy breakfast with extra, extra toppings, leisurely enjoying every bite.\nI was the class secretary, so it was easy for me to make up a lot of excuses for my 15-to-30-minute tardiness. I did this so frequently that everyone gradually stopped questioning the legitimacy. Getting away with it almost every time - the pinnacle of gaslighting, huh? =))\n\nThe daily inquiries were rather simple:\n\nWhat should I eat next?\nWhere should we hang out after school?\nShould we play Werewolves, Ribbit, or Exploding Kittens today?\n\n\nWould the literature teacher let us play board games instead? I probably shouldn’t be the one bringing it up since she wasn’t particularly fond of me.\nWe were in the middle of the game so it would suck if the flow is broken like this. A board game session typically lasts around 2 hours, but I have some teachers who are flexible enough to let us play through. That’s why I had the audacity to consider asking in the first place, though not all teachers were as accommodating.\n\nA Regime That Should Have Been Universal\nThe educational autonomy level was high, along with a hefty budget. We had the freedom to decide how to spend our time, with a monthly salary starting from a million —a huge amount back then,  far more than one student could reasonably spend— for basically existing.\nTo put it simply, the policy was:\n\nIf you wanted to play, play. If you wanted to learn, learn.\n\nBy all means, that was the best thing since sliced bread for me.\nI got the habit of playing truant since the regulations are so flexible and open. You get to decide what’s next for you; the temptation level is off the chart for a student, you see.\nI could attend only two lessons in the morning, go to the net to play video games, skip the afternoon lecture, and go to the coffee shop with my friends, who would skip with me.\nWhen I first got admitted, I did this a lot, with leading repercussions, of course… Still, I am lucky enough to have many friends of the same frequency who would do silly things with me and make so much memories, yet I could recount them like the back of my hand.\nEach class is financially independent, covering its own bills for electricity, water, and cleaning.\nWe had a 65’ touchscreen TV, JBL Speakers, and lots of mics 🎤🎤🎤.\nWe even bought a pine tree and snow-dry ice dispenser for Christmas.\nEvery day was either karaoke or movie day with mixed board games and debates (a type of roleplay with two opposing teams, parliamentary style).\nDespite all the temptations that might have been, the biggest one would have been not coming to class and missing out on something.\nKaraoke would probably be an indispensable daily activity.\nWe all shared the same music taste and could jam to the beat forever, do headbang, and even pull off dance covers. The stage is almost always overcrowded.\nI traveled with my class a lot, even by plane once, to many provinces in Vietnam. We even got to stay in Da Nang for 4 days during the fireworks season; that’s when I won my 3rd girlfriend, a.k.a current bff, over as well, making it kinda unforgettable for me :D. Needless to say, looking back, everything is full of laughter, joyfulness, and a lot of singing 🎵 🎶🎵.\nThat’s probably why I still love karaoke so much. Even though it’s never quite the same now, the experience always brings back those core memories subconsciously in the best way. Nostalgia hits hard 🥺😢\nBittersweet Epiphany\nFrom what I can recall, everyone was innocent and carefree in a sense, embracing every passing moment without the slightest care in the world. The inquiry of what would become of us, or what our hopes and dreams for the future were, never crossed our daily train of thought. Yet I’m certain they will become the brightest people I know; some already are and are on the brink of refining their identities.\nI can still remember that feeling, vaguely - the way dreaming came as naturally as breathing. Just now, I remember someone from those days gave us a name: 🌱Lámer.\nFor me, high school was when the seed of my fantasies and aspirations was planted, and the mold of my true self was finalized, all stemming from those naive and untroubled experiences. None of what I have achieved, or will achieve, could have happened without those everlasting moments when we could afford to be dreamers. Those fleeting, precious  days shaped our dreams and life trajectories, allowing us to envision a future filled with endless possibilities.\nWhy do I tell you all this? Why not?\nI realized some time ago that these privileges I received should not be taken for granted as I wouldn’t trade them for anything.\nNow, I see them as something I have to bear on my shoulders, my responsibilities.

Even though it’s on public domain :D\nTypically, I would jot down these reflections in my journal but for this occasion, to motivate you guys, to hopefully ignite a flame of undying passion for learning, I would like to share a snapshot of my life. First, one of my early mottos:\n\nMy thirst for knowledge will never be quenched.\n\nIf you don’t like it, then tough luck, take this as a reading task, and I’ve highlighted the vocabulary that you’ve learned, not the new ones.\nSo, to mark the commencement of our learning endeavor, here are your first tasks:\n\n\n                  \n                  This week&#039;s tasks \n                  \n                \n\n\n  First-level of recursion for new words on this reading task.\n Your comments/remarks (at least 3), send me personally or via group chat, suit you.\n Extra 2 points for those who note grammar structures used as well. An exhaustive one.\n\n\n\n⚠️Note  Minus 1 point for each vocabulary word you miss if asked. Missing means that you haven’t noted it yet.\nAutobiography\nPeople often tell me how “a normal person” would behave differently than I do, so I guess it’s only reasonable that my school life wasn’t typical either, lol.\nCompared to my peers, I didn’t study as much, playing most of the time and often doing the bare minimum or finding unconventional shortcuts to keep pace with them. But lucky me, the so-called “peers” were all geniuses, so I got put in place a lot. Even if I fooled around, the baseline level of effort to keep up helped me pass almost every important test entry.\nMy life has been the complete opposite and will probably become of this quote:\n\nYou either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\n\n\nWithout any intervention, wandering with perplexity and curiosity, I turned into a bad, but meticulous kid that no one seemed to notice.\n\n\nI believe the duality of one’s nature will always be present, but my poor decisions were taken lightly, or more accurately, went by unwares.\nI’m not proud, but thankfully, I could get back on the right track without much of a fight.\n\nPrimary School\nThis period was what I called “My Dark Era,” a time filled with confusion, all sort of emotions with no self-awareness, and restraint.\nI was a perfect role model student and a bully. I was too smart for my own good, excelling at anything I picked up so naturally I got things in my favor. People’s attention and praise probably took a heavy toll on me, but that was no excuse.\nMaybe subtle blame for uncontrollable primal instincts —aggression, violence, and the desperate need for validation and attention.😏\nNo need to delve further…\nSecondary School\nI called this period “The Storm After The Storm.” A got-away-with-it-somehow spoiled brat in the top class of the top school in my hometown.\nThe school wasn’t too far from my house, but it was still far enough for a spoiled kid to go on his own, and my parents couldn’t drop me off.\nTherefore, I got this uncalled-for luxury of going to school by taxi—yep, a taxi, with my neighborhood friends. Truly a story to be bragging about, for bourgeois families.\nThe academic life went south from here 😅 as the impulsive desires got the better of me. I skipped classes more than I skipped meals.\nI would told the driver to stop by the net on the way to school =))) and he would happily do so, since he was paid. Not my kid, not my problem 😂😂 Gotta respect that attitude though. Had a lot of fun and a lot of bad grades…\nI formed bonds with most of my closest friends here with the most unfiltered, raw, and rough version of myself, and the same goes for them. These low-maintenance relationships I believe will stay unstained, growing stronger yet unaffected by time and distance.\nWe were in the best, and also the wealthiest, class. We could go on weekend trips if any of the rich parents were happy that their kid scored a 10. A local prize would almost guarantee a trip, and a national one!? We’d have back-to-back class holidays! Without spending a dime.\nThis seemingly chill class turned out to have the highest unprecedented acceptance rate at Lam Son Gifted High School.\nI don’t think I’ll ever have as many extravagant extracurricular activities as I did back then. I got to see so much beauty and historical richness in Vietnam that I had always taken for granted.\nHigh School\nGetting into Lam Son has been my most significant cornerstone so far, though I didn’t realize it only until recently.\nIt’s not because of the school’s prestige or education (which, in and of itself, is remarkable) but because of the people here that changed me for the better, for good.\nMy typical day would start like this:\n\nI’d wake up late and rush to school, couldn’t make it on time, so I’d think, “screw it,” and go buy breakfast with extra, extra toppings, leisurely enjoying every bite.\nI was the class secretary, so it was easy for me to make up a lot of excuses for my 15-to-30-minute tardiness. I did this so frequently that everyone gradually stopped questioning the legitimacy. Getting away with it almost every time - the pinnacle of gaslighting, huh? =))\n\nThe daily inquiries were rather simple:\n\nWhat should I eat next?\nWhere should we hang out after school?\nShould we play Werewolves, Ribbit, or Exploding Kittens today?\n\n\nWould the literature teacher let us play board games instead? I probably shouldn’t be the one bringing it up since she wasn’t particularly fond of me.\nWe were in the middle of the game so it would suck if the flow is broken like this. A board game session typically lasts around 2 hours, but I have some teachers who are flexible enough to let us play through. That’s why I had the audacity to consider asking in the first place, though not all teachers were as accommodating.\n\nA Regime That Should Have Been Universal\nThe educational autonomy level was high, along with a hefty budget. We had the freedom to decide how to spend our time, with a monthly salary starting from a million —a huge amount back then,  far more than one student could reasonably spend— for basically existing.\nTo put it simply, the policy was:\n\nIf you wanted to play, play. If you wanted to learn, learn.\n\nBy all means, that was the best thing since sliced bread for me.\nI got the habit of playing truant since the regulations are so flexible and open. You get to decide what’s next for you; the temptation level is off the chart for a student, you see.\nI could attend only two lessons in the morning, go to the net to play video games, skip the afternoon lecture, and go to the coffee shop with my friends, who would skip with me.\nWhen I first got admitted, I did this a lot, with leading repercussions, of course… Still, I am lucky enough to have many friends of the same frequency who would do silly things with me and make so much memories, yet I could recount them like the back of my hand.\nEach class is financially independent, covering its own bills for electricity, water, and cleaning.\nWe had a 65’ touchscreen TV, JBL Speakers, and lots of mics 🎤🎤🎤.\nWe even bought a pine tree and snow-dry ice dispenser for Christmas.\nEvery day was either karaoke or movie day with mixed board games and debates (a type of roleplay with two opposing teams, parliamentary style).\nDespite all the temptations that might have been, the biggest one would have been not coming to class and missing out on something.\nKaraoke would probably be an indispensable daily activity.\nWe all shared the same music taste and could jam to the beat forever, do headbang, and even pull off dance covers. The stage is almost always overcrowded.\nI traveled with my class a lot, even by plane once, to many provinces in Vietnam. We even got to stay in Da Nang for 4 days during the fireworks season; that’s when I won my 3rd girlfriend, a.k.a current bff, over as well, making it kinda unforgettable for me :D. Needless to say, looking back, everything is full of laughter, joyfulness, and a lot of singing 🎵 🎶🎵.\nThat’s probably why I still love karaoke so much. Even though it’s never quite the same now, the experience always brings back those core memories subconsciously in the best way. Nostalgia hits hard 🥺😢\nBittersweet Epiphany\nFrom what I can recall, everyone was innocent and carefree in a sense, embracing every passing moment without the slightest care in the world. The inquiry of what would become of us, or what our hopes and dreams for the future were, never crossed our daily train of thought. Yet I’m certain they will become the brightest people I know; some already are and are on the brink of refining their identities.\nI can still remember that feeling, vaguely - the way dreaming came as naturally as breathing. Just now, I remember someone from those days gave us a name: 🌱Lámer.\nFor me, high school was when the seed of my fantasies and aspirations was planted, and the mold of my true self was finalized, all stemming from those naive and untroubled experiences. None of what I have achieved, or will achieve, could have happened without those everlasting moments when we could afford to be dreamers. Those fleeting, precious  days shaped our dreams and life trajectories, allowing us to envision a future filled with endless possibilities.\nWhy do I tell you all this? Why not?\nI realized some time ago that these privileges I received should not be taken for granted as I wouldn’t trade them for anything.\nNow, I see them as something I have to bear on my shoulders, my responsibilities. The spark of life 🌟I received should be passed down, not because I must or should, but because I want to, sincerely.\nPassing The Torch 🔥🔥🔥\nBack then, my mother brought up the idea that I should take on teaching as a profession. I used to despise that so much, claiming I hated teaching without any real reason — I still don’t know why I said that.\nIronically enough, I started tutoring in 12th grade, have had more than 100 students, and now you guys are my next endeavors.\nWith hindsight, my mom was quite a prophet, nhỉ?\nI often tell students about my teachers,  who put me on the right track even when I had strayed far from it —which fact never mattered to them.\nI owe a great deal to my life sabers for guiding me back during times I needed it most, even without me realizing it at the time.\nI realize that many kids would have been a lot better off had they met the teachers I once had, those who have the most unconventional methods that I can somewhat fathom now.\nMy very first students were forced upon me as favors asked by relatives, leaving me with little room for decline.

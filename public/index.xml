    <description>Greetings, Family Our class will begin this week, I hope that we will have a smooth sailing journey together. A Personal Note This is deeply personal for me, and I trusted you guys within my circle to keep this between us, so DO NOT share with anyone else, okay? Even though itâ€™s on public domain :D Typically, I would jot down these reflections in my journal but for this occasion, to motivate you guys, to hopefully ignite a flame of undying passion for learning, I would like to share a snapshot of my life.</description>

- Structure content with H2 (##) for Parts and H3 (###) for Question groups
- Place transcript at end under H3 Transcript heading
- Format transcript in callouts with unordered lists
- Add question index in parentheses after each answer
- Use consistent media embedding for both internal and external sources

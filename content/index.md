# Greetings, Family 

Our class will begin this week, I hope that we will have [[Be Smooth Sailing|a smooth sailing journey]] together.   

## A Personal Note

First, this is deeply personal for me, and I trusted you guys to [[Keep This Between Us|keep this between us]], so <mark class="hltr-red">DO NOT</mark> share with anyone, okay? Even though it's on public [[Domain|domain]] :D

Typically, I would **[[Jot Down|jot down]]** these [[Reflection|reflections]] in my journal [[But For Someone-something|but for]] this occasion, to [[Motivate|motivate]] you guys, to hopefully [[Ignite|ignite]] a flame of [[Undying Passion|undying passion]] for learning, I would like to share a [[Snapshot|snapshot]] of my life. First, one of my early [[motto|mottos]]:
> My [[Thirst After-for Something|thirst for knowledge]] will never be **[[Quench|quenched]].**

If you don't like it, then tough luck, take this as a reading task, and I've **highlighted** the vocabulary that you've learned, not the new ones.
So, to mark the [[commencement|commencement]] of our learning [[endeavor|endeavor]], here are your first tasks:

> [!Example] This week's tasks
> - [ ]  First-level of [[recursion|recursion]] for new words on this reading task.
> - [ ] Your comments/remarks (at least 3), send me personally or [[Via|via]] group chat, suit you.
> - [ ] Extra 2 points for those who note grammar structures used as well. An [[exhaustive|exhaustive]] one.

<mark class="hltr-orange">‚ö†Ô∏èNote</mark>  Minus 1 point for each vocabulary word you miss if asked. Missing means that you haven't noted it yet.

# [[Autobiography|Autobiography]]
People often tell me how "a normal person" would [[Behave|behave]] differently than I do, so I guess it's only [[Reasonable|reasonable]] that my school life wasn't typical either, lol.

Compared to my [[Peer|peers]], I didn't study as much, playing most of the time and often doing [[The Bare Minimum|the bare minimum]] or finding **[[Unconventional|unconventional]]** shortcuts [[To Keep Pace With|to keep pace with]] them. But lucky me, the [[So-Called|so-called]] "[[Peer|peers]]" were all geniuses, so I got [[Put|put]] in place a lot. Even if I [[Fool Around|fooled around]], the [[Baseline|baseline]] level of effort to [[Keep Up|keep up]] helped me pass almost every important test entry.

My life has been the complete opposite and will probably become of this quote:
> *You either die a hero, or [[Live|live]] long enough to see yourself become the villain.*

>Without any [[Intervention|intervention]], [[Wander|wandering]] with [[perplexity|perplexity]] and [[Curiosity|curiosity]], I [[Turn Into|turned into]] a bad, but [[meticulous|meticulous]] kid that no one seemed to notice.

>I believe [[The Duality Of One's Nature|the duality of one's nature]] will always be present, but my [[Poor|poor]] decisions were taken lightly, or more accurately, went by **[[Unawares|unawares]]**.
>I'm not proud, but thankfully, I could [[Get|get]] back [[On The Right Track|on the right track]] without [[Much Of A Fight|much of a fight]].

## Primary School

This period was what I called *"A Dark Era,"* a time [[Fill something with something|filled with]] confusion and all sorts of emotions with no self-[[Awareness|awareness]] and [[restraint|restraint]]. 

I was a perfect [[Role Model|role model]] student and, [[Better Yet|better yet]], a bully. 
Too sharp [[For Your-Someone'S Own Good|for my own good]], excelling at anything I [[Pick Up|picked up]], so naturally, I got things in my favor. 
People‚Äôs attention and [[Praise|praise]] probably [[Take Its-A Toll(On)|took a heavy toll on me]], [[Feed An Ego|feeding an ego]] that I didn‚Äôt know how to process, but that was no excuse. I was led [[Astray|astray]], blinded by the rewards and [[Recognition|recognition]].

Maybe subtle [[Blame For|blame for]] [[Uncontrollable|uncontrollable]] [[Primal Instincts|primal instincts]]‚Äî[[Aggression|aggression]], [[Violence|violence]], and the [[Desperate|desperate]] need for [[validation|validation]].üòå

Let's not [[delve|delve]] further...

## Secondary School

### The Muted [[aftermath|Aftermath]]
A [[Get Away With Something|got-away-with-it-somehow]] spoiled brat [[End up|ended up]] in the top class of the top secondary school. I came to my senses only much later on, back then I was still feigning [[Ignorance|ignorance]] and acting [[On Impulse|on impulse]], as most children would.

The school wasn't too far from my house, but still far enough for a kid to go on his own, and my parents couldn't [[Drop Off|drop me off]] either.
Therefore, I got this [[Uncalled-For|uncalled-for]] luxury of going to school by taxi‚Äîyep, a taxi, alongside my neighborhood friends. Truly a story to be [[Brag|bragging about]], for [[Bourgeois|bourgeois]] families.

The academic life [[Go South|went south]] from here üòÖ as the [[impetuous|impetuous]] desires [[get the better of|got the better of me]]. I skipped classes more than I skipped meals.

I would told the [[Cab Driver|cab driver]] to stop by the net on the way to school =))) and he would happily do so, since he was paid. Not my kid, not my problem üòÇüòÇ Gotta respect that [[Attitude|attitude]]. Had a lot of fun and a lot of bad grades... Everything was on a [[downward spiral|downward spiral]], yet funny enough, I never got caught or [[Confront|confronted]].

### Underappreciated Youth
I formed bonds with most of my closest friends here with the most [[unfiltered|unfiltered]], raw, and rough version of myself. [[The same goes for|The same goes for]] them. 
These [[Low-maintenance|low-maintenance]] relationships, I believe, will stay [[Unstained|unstained]], growing stronger yet unaffected by time and distance as it has always been.

We were not only in the best but also the wealthiest class. We could go on weekend trips if any of the generous parents were happy that their kid scored a 10. A local prize would almost [[Guarantee|guarantee]] a trip and a national one!? We‚Äôd have [[Back To Back|back-to-back]] class holidays! Without spending a [[dime|dime]].

This [[Seemingly|seemingly]] chill class [[Turn Out To|turned out to]] have the ==highest unprecedented acceptance rate== at Lam Son Gifted High School.

I [[Doubt|doubt]] I'll ever have as many [[extravagant|extravagant]] field trips as I did back then. I got to see so much of Vietnam's beauty and historical [[Richness|richness]] ‚Äî things I **had long taken for granted**.

But it wasn‚Äôt [[Just|just]] the scenes and places I [[Overlook|overlooked]]; it was the people too. I discovered so many new emotions‚Äîones that were [[pivotal|pivotal]], [[Inevitable|inevitable]], but [[Bitterish|bitterish]]‚Äîregret, [[Sorrow|sorrow]], rage, and that heartbroken feeling, or whatever you‚Äôd name it.

Most of these feelings were [[Direct Something At Someone-something|directed at myself]]: for the decisions I left unmade, for the [[Precious|precious]] people I failed to [[Cherish|cherish]] until they quietly walked out of my life forever.

Though painful, these realizations became the compass points guiding my future path and were [[The Turning Point|the turning point]] for me. 

## High School

Getting into Lam Son has been my most significant [[Cornerstone|cornerstone]], though I didn't realize it only until recently. 
It wasn't the school's [[prestige|prestige]] or education (which, in and of itself, is remarkable) that [[Make Difference|made the difference]]‚Äîit was the people here who changed me for the better, forever.

My typical day here would start like this: 
> I'd wake up late and rush to school, couldn't [[Make|make]] it on time, thinking "[[Screw it|screw it]]," and go buy breakfast with extra, extra toppings, leisurely enjoying every bite. 
>
> I was the class [[Secretary|secretary]], so it was easy for me to **[[Make Up|make up]]** a lot of excuses for my 15-to-30-minute [[tardiness|tardiness]]. I did this so frequently that everyone gradually stopped questioning my [[Legitimacy|legitimacy]]. 
> [[Getting Away With It|Getting away with it]] almost every time - the [[Pinnacle|pinnacle]] of [[gaslighting|gaslighting]], huh?


The daily [[Inquiry|inquiries]] were rather [[Simple|simple]]:
>What should I eat next?
>
>Where should we [[Hang Out|hang out]] after school?
>
>Should we play Werewolves, Ribbit, or Exploding Kittens today? 
>
>What [[Rhetorical Question|rhetorical questions]] should I ask to [[Make|make]] it more impactful during the [[Debate|debate]]?
>
>Would the Literature teacher let us play board games instead? I probably shouldn't be the one [[Bring Up|bringing it up]] since she wasn't particularly fond of me. 
>
>We were in the middle of the game so it would suck if the flow is broken like this. 
>
>A board game session typically lasts around 2 hours, but some teachers were [[Flexible|flexible]] enough to let us play through. That's why I had the [[Audacity|Audacity]] to consider asking in the first place, though not all were as [[Accommodating|accommodating]].

### A [[Regime|Regime]] That Should Have Been Universal
The educational [[Autonomy|autonomy]] level I got was [[unprecedentedly|unprecedentedly]] and [[inimitably|inimitably]] high, along with a [[hefty|hefty]] budget for students. 

We had the freedom to decide how to spend our time, with a monthly salary [[Exceed|exceeding]] a million ‚Äîa huge amount back then,  far more than one student could reasonably spend‚Äî for basically existing. 

Students who lived a bit **[[Off The Beaten Track|off the beaten track]]** would earn almost twice as much. 
Big [[Monetary|monetary]] rewards were given (around 9.000.000‚Ç´ per [[semester|semester]] per student) for getting an 8.5 GPA, which was not hard, at all. 
The school's monthly budget for us was roughly 2 billion VND, [[as stated by|as stated by]] the [[Headmaster|headmaster]].
[[Amidst|Amidst]] all this, the school policy was:
> *If you wanted to play, play. If you wanted to learn, learn.* 

By all means, that was **[[The Best Thing Since Sliced Bread|the best thing since sliced bread]]** for me.

I got the habit of playing [[truant|truant]] since the [[Regulation|regulations]] are so [[Flexible|flexible]] and open. You got to decide what's next for you; the [[Temptation|temptation]] level is obviously **[[Off The Chart|off the chart]]** for a student, you see.

I could [[Attend|attend]] only half the lessons (usually two) in the morning, go to the net to play video games, skip the afternoon lecture, and go to the coffee shop with my friends, who would skip as well. 
When I first got admitted, I did this a lot, with leading [[repercussion|repercussions]], of course... Still, I am lucky enough to have many friends of the same frequency who would do those [[Silly|silly]] stuff with me and [[Make|make]] so much memories, yet I could [[Recount|recount]] them like **the back of my hand**. 

Each class is [[Financially Independent|financially independent]], covering its own bills for electricity, water, and cleaning.
We had a 65' touchscreen TV, 2 pairs of JBL Speakers [[In The Name Of Someone-Something|in the name of]] learning listening üòÇ, and lots of mics üé§üé§üé§.
We even bought a pine tree and snow-dry ice [[dispenser|dispenser]] for Christmas.
Every day was either karaoke or movie day with mixed board games and [[Debate|debate]] [[Contest|contests]] (a type of [[Roleplay|roleplay]] with two opposing teams in [parliamentary style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_system), regarding local issues to international [[dilemma|dilemmas]]).

Karaoke was almost an [[Indispensable|indispensable]] daily activity, or at least I made it so.
We all shared the same music taste and could [[Jam To|jam to]] the beat forever, do [[Headbang|headbang]], and even **[[Pull Off|pull off]]** dance covers. The stage was almost always overcrowded.

Despite all the temptations that might have been, the biggest one was not coming to class and **[[Missing Out On|missing out on]]** something. I stopped playing [[truant|truant]], more or [[Less|less]]. 

We traveled a lot, even by plane once, to various provinces in Vietnam. We even got to spend 4 days in Da Nang during the fireworks season; that's when I won my 3rd girlfriend, a.k.a current bff, over as well, making it kinda [[Memorable|memorable]] for me. Needless to say, looking back, everything is full of laughter, thrills, and endless singing üéµ üé∂üéµ. 

That's probably why I love karaoke; it feels like stepping into a [[Bittersweet|bittersweet]] [[Simulation|simulation]]. Though it's never quite the same, the experience always brings back those core memories [[Subconsciously|subconsciously]] in the best way. 

[[nostalgia|Nostalgia]] hits hard ü•∫üò¢
### [[Bittersweet|Bittersweet]] [[epiphany|Epiphany]]
From what I can recall, everyone was [[Innocent|innocent]] and [[Carefree|carefree]] in a sense, embracing every passing moment without the slightest care in the world. 

The [[Inquiry|inquiry]] of what would [[Become Of Us|become of us]], or what our hopes and dreams for the future were, never crossed our daily **[[Train Of Thought|train of thought]]**. Yet I'm certain they will become the brightest people I know; some already are and are [[On The Brink Of|on the brink of]] [[Refine|refining]] their identities.

I can still remember that feeling, [[vaguely|vaguely]] - the way dreaming [[As Naturally As Breathing|came as naturally as breathing]]. [[Just|Just]] now, I remember someone from those days gave us a name: üå±L√°mer.

For me, high school was when [[The Seed Of|the seed of]] my [[Fantasy|fantasies]] and [[Aspiration|aspirations]] was planted, and the mold of my true self was finalized, all [[stem|stemming]] from those [[Naive|naive]] and [[Untroubled|untroubled]] experiences. None of what I have achieved, or will achieve, **could have happened** without those [[Everlasting|everlasting]] moments when we could afford to be dreamers. Those [[fleeting|fleeting]], [[Precious|precious]]  days shaped our dreams and life [[Trajectory|trajectories]], allowing us to [[Envision|envision]] a future [[Fill something with something|filled with]] endless possibilities.

# ~~Why do I tell you all this?~~ Why not?

I realized some time ago that the [[Privilege|privileges]] I received should not be taken for granted, as I wouldn't trade them for anything. 
Now, I see them as something I **have to [[Bear|bear]]** on my shoulders, my responsibilities. The spark of life üåüI received is something I long to share, [[Driven By|driven by]] both my sense of [[Obligation|obligation]] and [[wholeheartedness|wholeheartedness]]. 
### [[Pass The Torch|Passing The Torch]] üî•üî•üî•
Back in the days, my mother brought up the idea that I should [[Take On|take on]] teaching as a profession. I used to [[Despise|despise]] that so much, claiming I hated teaching without any real reason‚ÄîI still don't know why I said that. 
[[Ironically Enough|Ironically enough]], I started tutoring in 12th grade, have had more than 100 students, and now you guys are my next endeavors. 

With [[hindsight|hindsight]], my mom was quite a [[prophet|prophet]], nh·ªâ?

I often tell students about my teachers,  who **[[Put|put]] me [[On The Right Track|on the right track]]** even when I had strayed far from it‚Äîwhich fact never mattered to them. 
I owe a great deal to my life sabers for guiding me during times I needed it most, even without realizing it at the time. 

I realized that many kids would have been a lot [[Better Off|better off]] **had they met** the teachers I once had, those who have the most [[Unconventional|unconventional]] methods that I can somewhat [[fathom|fathom]] now.

My very first students were **[[Force Upon|forced upon]]** me as favors asked by relatives, [[Leave With Little Room For|leaving me with little room for]] decline. Slowly but surely, teaching had **crept up on** me and [[intrigue|intrigued]] me as I saw the growth and influence it can have on both parties.

Even though I'm still learning, I feel like I've got a lot to share. 
 > *Sharing Is Caring.*
>
Knowledge isn't meant to be [[hoard|hoarded]] like treasure ‚Äî it's meant to flow freely, like water. I've been fortunate enough to **[[Stumble Upon|stumble upon]]** this cheat code, and it would be selfish to keep it to myself.

### Cheat Code For Life
I believe I [[Possess|possess]] a wide [[spectrum|spectrum]] of emotions and strong knowledge [[Utilization|utilization]] and I attribute this sort of [[Accomplishment|accomplishment]] largely to learning languages.

Out of all the skills I've learned, learning English has been my ultimate cheat code. I see it as a bridge that connects me to anywhere, any souls across cultures.

I still remember the first time I heard lyrics in a language not my [[Mother Tongue|mother tongue]], yet they [[resonate|resonated]] deeply. I had **[[Butterflies In My Stomach|butterflies in my stomach]]**, a sadness so [[Profound|profound]] that it [[wrench|wrenched]] my heart. That feeling when words [[Echo|echo]] straight to the heart, not the brain ‚Äî I felt like discovering an entirely new part of myself. 

Then, the new refreshing experiences kept flowing: **[[Breaking Down|breaking down]]** in tears watching movies, [[Giggle|giggling]] at random jokes in the comments, discovering beauty hidden **between the lines**, having words spiraling out of your mind that you didn't know were in your possession, and finally seeing the [[Payoff|payoff]] of your efforts.

From the moment I can proudly claim English as my second language, I felt like I got a master key that unlock [[Virtually|virtually]] every door. I've **[[Walk In The Shoes Of|walked in the shoes]] of** people from different corners of the world, sharing nothing but a common language, yet it was enough to [[Foster|foster]] both [[Sympathy|sympathy]] and [[Empathy|empathy]].

Each conversation, each perspective shared, reshapes my understanding of the world. With the advent of the Internet, it's like having multiple lives in [[Parallel|parallel]]: experiencing countless joys, struggles, [[triumph|triumphs]], and so many unnamed emotions through the eyes of people I've never met. Truly a cheat code. 

While this might seem [[Commonplace|commonplace]] to some, we [[Fall Into|fell into]] the category of those who weren't **[[entitled|entitled]] to** it. 
It upsets and frustrates me to see so many may forever remain ignorant of the potential of their growth **had they known** a few more things. 

The foreign viewpoint that reduces a language to [[Merely|merely]] a subject exists only because they haven't witnessed its [[Miracle|miracles]] ‚Äî how it can transform your outlook overnight. 

What they [[Dismiss|dismiss]] as "[[Just|just]] English" is actually a portal to infinite [[Glitch|glitches]]: to friendships that span [[Continent|continents]], to knowledge that hasn't been translated or [[Better Yet|better yet]] translated into this most accessible language, to perspectives that challenge everything you know, to opportunities that others can't ever [[fathom|fathom]].

They haven't yet realized that a language isn't [[Just|just]] a tool for communication‚Äîit's a lens through which to view the world, a key to unlock different versions of yourself [[simultaneously|simultaneously]], to experience the cultural and personality [[Subtle Shift|subtle shift]] as you switch language, and ultimately to a more [[prosperous|prosperous]] [[Eye-Opening|eye-opening]] life.

If you have [[faith|faith]] in yourself and trust in me:
> *Those desired objectives will become your realities.*

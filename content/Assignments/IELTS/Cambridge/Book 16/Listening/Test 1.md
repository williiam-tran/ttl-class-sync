> - Specifically, | am referring to Stoicism, which, in my opinion, is the most practical of all philosophies and therefore the most appealing. ==Stoicism was founded in Ancient Greece by Zeno== of Citium in the early 3rd century BC, but was practised by the likes of Epictetus, Cato.
> - Amazingly, we still have access to these ideas, despite the fact that the most famous Stoics never wrote anything down for publication. Cato definitely didn’t. Marcus Aurelius never intended his Meditations to be anything but personal. (32)
> - The road to virtue, in turn, lay in understanding that destructive emotions, like anger and jealousy, are under our conscious control — they don’t have to control us, because we can learn to control them. In the words of Epictetus: “external events | cannot control. but the choices | make with regard to them Ido control”. (33)
> - The modern day philosopher and writer Nassim Nicholas Taleb defines a Stoic as someone who has a different perspective on experiences which most of us would see as wholly negative;  (34)
> - The founding fathers of the United States were inspired by the philosophy. George Washington was introduced to Stoicism by his neighbours at age seventeen, and later, put on a play based on the life of Cato to inspire his men. Thomas Jefferson kept a copy of Seneca beside his bed. (35)
> - The economist Adam Smith's theories on capitalism were significantly influenced by the Stoicism that he studied as a schoolboy, under a teacher who had translated Marcus Aurelius’ works. (36)
> - Stoicism had a profound influence on Albert Ellis, who invented Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, which is used to help people manage their problems by changing the way that they think and behave. It's most commonly used to treat depression. The idea is that we can take control of our lives by challenging the irrational beliefs that create our faulty thinking, symptoms and behaviours by using logic instead. (37)
> - Stoicism has also become popular in the world of business. Stoic principles can build the resilience and state of mind required to overcome setbacks because Stoics teach turning obstacles into opportunity. A lesson every business entrepreneur needs to learn. (38)
> - | would argue that studying Stoicism is as relevant today as it was 2,000 years ago, thanks to its brilliant insights into how to lead a good life. At the very root of the thinking, there is a very simple way of living — control what you can and accept what you can’t. This is not as easy as it sounds and will require considerable practice — it can take a lifetime to master. The Stoics also believed the most important foundation for a good and happy life is not money, fame, power or pleasure, but having a disciplined and principled character — something which seems to resonate with many people today.

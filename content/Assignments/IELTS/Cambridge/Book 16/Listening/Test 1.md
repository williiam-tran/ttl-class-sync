### Transcript

> [!Info]- Part 4
> - Specifically, I am referring to Stoicism, which, in my opinion, is the most practical of all philosophies and therefore the most appealing. ==Zeno== (31) of Citium in the early 3rd century BC, but was practised by the likes of Epictetus, Cato.
> - Amazingly, we still have access to these ideas, despite the fact that the most famous Stoics never wrote anything down for publication. Cato definitely didn't. ==personal== (32)
> - The road to virtue, in turn, lay in understanding that destructive emotions, like anger and jealousy, are under our conscious control â€” they don't have to control us, because we can learn to control them. In the words of Epictetus: "==I do control== (33)".
> - The modern day philosopher and writer Nassim Nicholas Taleb defines a Stoic as someone who has ==a different perspective== (34) on experiences which most of us would see as wholly negative.
> - The founding fathers of the United States were inspired by the philosophy. George Washington was introduced to Stoicism by his neighbours at age seventeen, and later, put on a play based on the life of Cato to inspire his men. ==Seneca== (35)
> - The economist Adam Smith's theories on capitalism were significantly influenced by the Stoicism that he studied as a schoolboy, under a teacher who had ==translated Marcus Aurelius' works== (36).
> - Stoicism had a profound influence on Albert Ellis, who invented ==Cognitive Behaviour Therapy== (37), which is used to help people manage their problems by changing the way that they think and behave.
> - Stoicism has also become popular in the world of business. Stoic principles can build the resilience and state of mind required to overcome setbacks because Stoics teach ==turning obstacles into opportunity== (38).
> - The Stoics also believed the most important foundation for a good and happy life is not money, fame, power or pleasure, but having ==a disciplined and principled character== (39).

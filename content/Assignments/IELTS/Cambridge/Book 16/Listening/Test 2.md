- EMPLOYEE:     Hello, Picturerep. Can I help you?
- WOMAN:        Oh, hi. I saw your advertisement about copying pictures to disk and I’d like a bit more information about what you do.
- EMPLOYEE:     Sure. What would you like to know?
- WOMAN:        Well, I’ve got a box full of old family photos that’s been up in the ==attic== for years, some of them must be 50 or 60 years old, and I’d like to get them ==converted== to digital format.
- EMPLOYEE:     Sure, we can do that for you.
- WOMAN:        Right. And what about size? The photos are all sorts of sizes – are there any ==restrictions==?
- EMPLOYEE:     Well the maximum size of photo we can do with our normal services is 30 centimetres. And each picture must be at least 4 centimetres, that’s the minimum we can ==cope with==.
- WOMAN:        That should be fine. And some of them are in a ==frame== (Q1) – should I take them out before I send them?
- EMPLOYEE:     Yes please, we can’t copy them otherwise. And also the photos must all be separate, they mustn’t be stuck into an album.
- WOMAN:        OK, that’s not a problem. So can you give me an idea of how much this will cost? I’ve got about 360 photos I think.
- EMPLOYEE:     We charge ==£195 for 300 to 400 photos== (Q2) for the basic service.
- WOMAN:        OK. And does that include the disk?
- EMPLOYEE:     Yes, one disk – but you can get extra ones for £5 each.
- WOMAN:        That’s good. So do I need to pay when I send you the photos?
- EMPLOYEE:     No, we won’t need anything until we’ve actually copied the pictures. Then we’ll let you know how much it is, and ==once we’ve received the payment== (Q3), we’ll ==send the parcel off== to you.
- WOMAN:        Right.
- EMPLOYEE:     Is there anything else you’d like to ask about our services?
- WOMAN:        Yes. I’ve roughly sorted out the photos into groups, according to what they’re about – so can you keep them in those groups when you copy them?
- EMPLOYEE:     Sure. We’ll save each group in a different folder on the disk and if you like, you can suggest a name for each folder.
- WOMAN:        So I could have one called ==‘Grandparents’== (Q4) for instance?
- EMPLOYEE:     Exactly.
- WOMAN:        And do you do anything besides scan the photos? Like, can you make any ==improvements==?
- EMPLOYEE:     Yes, in the standard service each photo is checked, and we can sometimes ==touch up the colour a bit== (Q5), or improve the contrast – that can make a big difference.
- WOMAN:        OK. And some of the photos are actually quite ==fragile== – they won’t get damaged in the process, will they?
- EMPLOYEE:     No, if any look particularly fragile, ==we’d do them by hand== (Q6). We do realise how ==precious== these old photos can be.
- WOMAN:        Sure.
- EMPLOYEE:     And another thing is we can make changes to a photo if you want – so if you want to remove an object from a photo, or maybe ==alter the background== (Q7), we can do that.
- WOMAN:        Really? I might be interested in that. I’ll have a look through the photos and see. Oh, and talking of fixing photos – I’ve got a few that ==aren’t properly in focus== (Q8). Can you do anything to make that better?
- EMPLOYEE:     No, I’m afraid that’s one thing we can’t do.
- WOMAN:        OK.
- EMPLOYEE:     Any other information I can give you?
- WOMAN:        Er … oh, how long will it all take?
- EMPLOYEE:     We aim to get the copying done ==in ten days==. (Q9)
- WOMAN:        Fine. Right, well I’ll get the photos ==packed up== in a box and ==post them off== to you.
- EMPLOYEE:     Right. If you’ve got a strong cardboard box, that’s best. We’ve found that plastic ==ones sometimes break in the post==. (Q10)
- WOMAN:        OK. Right, thanks for your help. Bye.
- EMPLOYEE:     Bye.

- Good morning and thank you for coming here today. I’d like to bring you up to date with changes in the school that will affect your children.

- As you know, the school buildings date from various times: some from the 1970s, some from the last five years, and of course Dartfield House is over a century old. It was ==commissioned== by a businessman. Neville Richards, and ==intended== as his family home, but he died before it was completed. ==His heir chose to sell it to the local council, who turned it into offices== (Q11). A later plan to convert it into a tourist information centre didn’t come about, through lack of money, and instead it formed ==the nucleus of== this school when it opened 40 years ago.

- The school has grown as the local population has increased, and I can now give you some news about the lower school site, which is separated from the main site by a road. Planning ==permission== has been granted for development of both sites. The lower school will move to new buildings that will be constructed on the main site. ==Developers will construct houses on the existing lower school site== (Q12). Work on the new school buildings should start within the next few months.

- A more ==imminent== change concerns the ==catering== facilities and the canteen. The canteen is always very busy throughout the lunch period – in fact it’s often full to capacity, because a lot of our pupils like the food that’s on offer there. But there’s only one serving point, so ==most pupils have to wait a considerable time to be served== (Q13). This is obviously ==unsatisfactory==, as they may have hardly finished their lunch before afternoon lessons start.

- So we’ve had a new Food Hall built, and this will come into use next week. It’ll have several serving areas, and I’ll give you more details about those in a minute, but one thing we ask you to do, to help in the smooth running of the Food Hall, is to ==discuss with your children each morning which type of food they want to eat that day== (Q14), so they can go straight to the ==relevant== serving point. There won’t be any junk food – everything on offer will be healthy – and there’s no change to the current system of paying for lunches by topping up your child’s electronic payment card online.

- You may be wondering what will happen to the old canteen. ==We’ll still have tables and chairs in there, and pupils can eat food from the Food Hall or lunch they’ve brought from home== (Q15). Eventually we may use part of the canteen for storage, but first we’ll see how many pupils go in there at lunchtime.

- OK, back to the serving points in the Food Hall, which will all have side dishes, desserts and drinks on sale, as well as main courses.

- One serving point we call ==World Adventures== (Q16). This will serve ==a different country’s cuisine each day==, maybe Chinese one day and Lebanese the next. The ==menus== will be planned for a week at a time, so pupils will know what’s going to be available the whole of the week.

- ==Street Life== is also international, with food from three particular cultures. ==We’ll ask pupils to make suggestions== (Q17), so perhaps sometimes there’ll be food from Thailand, Ethiopia and Mexico, and then one of them will be replaced by Jamaican food for a week or two.

- The Speedy Italian serving point ==will cater particularly for the many pupils who don’t eat meat or fish== (Q18): they can be sure that all the food served there is ==suitable for== them. There’ll be plenty of variety, so they shouldn’t get bored with the food.

- OK, that’s all on the new Food Hall. Now after-school lessons. There are very popular with pupils, particularly swimming – in fact there’s a waiting list for lessons. Cycling is another favourite, and I’m delighted that dozens of pupils ==make use of== the chance to learn to ride in ==off-road== conditions. It means that more and more cycle to and from school every day. As you know, we have a well-equipped performance centre, and ==we’re going to start drama classes== (Q19/Q20) in there, too. Pupils will be able to join in just for fun or work up to taking part in a play – we hope to put on at least one a year. We already teach a number of pupils to use the sound and lighting systems in the centre. And a ==former== pupil has given a ==magnificent== grand piano to the school, so ==a few pupils will be able to learn at the school instead of going to the local college== (Q19/20), as many of them do at the moment.

- SUSIE:     So Luke, for our next psychology assignment we have to do something on sleep and dreams.
- LUKE:      Right. I’ve just read an article suggesting why we ==tend to== forget most of our dreams soon after we wake up. I mean, most of my dreams aren’t that interesting anyway, but what it said was that if we remembered everything, ==we might get mixed up about what actually happened and what we dreamed== (Q21). So it’s a sort of protection. I hadn’t heard that idea before. I’d always ==assumed== that it was just that we didn’t have room in our memories for all that stuff.
- SUSIE:     Me too. What do you think about the idea that our dreams may ==predict== the future?
- LUKE:      It’s a belief that you get all over the world.
- SUSIE:     Yeah, lots of people have a story of it happening to them, but the explanation I’ve read is that ==for each dream that comes true, we have thousands that don’t== (Q22), but we don’t notice those, we don’t even remember them. We just remember the ones where something in the real world, like a view or an action, happens to ==trigger== a dream memory.
- LUKE:      Right. ==So it’s just a coincidence really==. Something else I read about is what they call ==segmented== sleeping. That’s a theory that hundreds of years ago, people used to get up in the middle of the night and have a chat or something to eat, then go back to bed. So I tried it myself.
- SUSIE:     Why?
- LUKE:      Well it’s meant to make you more creative. I don’t know why. But I ==gave it up== after a week. It just didn’t fit in with my lifestyle.
- SUSIE:     But most pre-school children have a short sleep in the day don’t they? There was an experiment some students did here last ==term== to see at what age kids should stop having naps. ==But they didn’t really find an answer== (Q23). They spent a lot of time working out the most appropriate ==methodology==, ==but the results didn’t seem to show any obvious patterns==.
- LUKE:      Right. Anyway, let’s think about our assignment. Last time ==I had problems with the final stage, where we had to describe and justify how successful we thought we’d been== (Q24). I struggled a bit with the action plan too.
- SUSIE:     I was OK with the planning, but ==I got marked down for the self-assessment as well==. And I had big problems with the ==statistical== stuff, that’s where I really lost marks.
- LUKE:      Right.

- SUSIE:     So shall we plan what we have to do for this assignment?
- LUKE:      OK.
- SUSIE:     First, we have to decide on our research question. So how about ‘Is there a relationship between hours of sleep and number of dreams?’
- LUKE:      OK. Then we need to think about who we’ll do they study on. About 12 people?
- SUSIE:     Right. And shall we use other psychology students?
- LUKE:      ==Let’s use people from a different department. What about history?== (Q25)
- SUSIE:     Yes, they might have interesting dreams! Or literature students?
- LUKE:      I don’t really know any.
- SUSIE:     OK, forget that idea. Then we have to think about our methodology. So we could use observation, but that doesn’t seem appropriate.
- LUKE:      No. it needs to be ==self-reporting== I think. And we could ask them to answer questions online.
- SUSIE:     But in this case, ==paper might be better== (Q26) as they’ll be doing it straight after they wake up … in fact while they’re still half-asleep.
- LUKE:      Right. And we’ll have to ==check the ethical guidelines== (Q27) for this sort of research.
- SUSIE:     Mm, ==because our experiment involves humans==, so there are special ==regulations==.
- LUKE:      Yes, I had a look at those for another assignment I did. There’s a whole section on risk assessment, and another section on ==making sure they aren’t put under any unnecessary stress==. (Q28)
- SUSIE:     Let’s hope they don’t have any bad dreams!
- LUKE:      Yeah.
- SUSIE:     Then when we’ve collected all our data we have to ==analyse== it and calculate the ==correlation== between our two ==variables==, that’s time sleeping and number of dreams and then ==present our results visually in a graph==. (Q29)
- LUKE:      Right. And the final thing is to think about ==our research== and ==evaluate== it (Q30). So that seems quite ==straightforward==.
- SUSIE:     Yeah. So now let’s …

- Dancing is something that humans do when they want to have a good time. It’s a ==universal== response to music, found in all cultures. But what’s only been discovered recently is that dancing not only makes us feel good, it’s also extremely good for our health.

- Dancing, like other forms of exercise, releases ==hormones==, such as ==dopamine==, which make us feel relaxed and happy. And it also reduces feelings of stress or anxiety.

- Dancing is also a sociable activity, which is another reason it makes us feel good.

- One study compared people’s enjoyment of dancing at home in front of a video with dancing in a group in a studio.

- The people dancing in a group reported feeling happier, whereas those dancing alone did not.

- In another experiment, university researchers at York and Sheffield took ==a group of students== and sent each of them into a lab where music was played for five minutes. Each had to choose from three options: to sit and listen quietly to the music, to cycle on an exercise bike while they listened, or to get up and dance. All were given ==cognitive== tasks to perform before and after. The result showed that ==those who chose to dance showed much more creativity== (Q31) when doing problem-solving tasks.

- Doctor Lovatt at the University of Hertfordshire believes dance could be a very useful way to help people suffering from mental health problems. He thinks ==dance should be prescribed as therapy== (Q32) to help people ==overcome== issues such as depression.

- It’s well ==established== that dance is a good way of encouraging adolescent girls to take exercise but what about ==older people==? Studies have shown that there are ==enormous== benefits for people in their sixties and beyond. One of the great things about dance is that there are no barriers to participation. Anyone can have a go, even those whose ==standard of fitness is quite low==. (Q33)

- Dance can be especially beneficial for older adults who can’t run or do more intense workouts, or for those who don’t want to. One 2015 study found that even a gently dance workout helps to ==promote== a healthy heart. And there’s plenty of ==evidence== which suggests that dancing lowers the risk of falls, which could result in a broken hip, for example, by helping people ==to improve their balance==. (Q34)

- There are some less obvious benefits of dance for older people too. One thing I hadn’t realised before researching this topic was that dance isn’t just a physical challenge. It also requires a lot of ==concentration== because you need to remember different steps and routines. For older people, this kind of activity is especially important because ==it forces their brain to process things more quickly== (Q35) and to ==retain== more information.

- Current research also shows that dance promotes a general sense of ==well-being== in older participants, which can last up to a week after a class. Participants report feeling less tired and having ==greater motivation to be more active== (Q36) and do daily activities such as gardening or walking to the shops or a park.

- ==Ballroom== or country dancing, both popular with older people, have to be done in groups. They require ==collaboration== and often involve touching a dance partner, all of which encourages interaction on the dance floor. This helps to develop new relationships and can ==reduce older people’s sense of isolation== (Q37), which is a huge problem in many countries.

- I also looked at the benefits of Zumba. Fifteen million people in 180 countries now regularly take a Zumba class, an ==aerobic== workout based on Latin American dance moves. John Porcari, a professor of exercise and sport science at the University of Wisconsin, analysed a group of women who were ==Zumba regulars== and found that ==a class lasting 40 minutes burns about 370 calories. This is similar to moderately intense exercises== (Q38) like step aerobics or kickboxing.

- A study in the American Journal of Health Behavior showed that ==when women with obesity== (Q39) did Zumba three times a week for 16 weeks, they ==lost an average of 1.2 kilos and lowered their percentage of body fat by 1%==. More importantly, the women enjoyed the class so much that ==they made it a habit== (Q40) and continued to attend classes at least once a week – very unusual for an aerobic exercise programme.

- Dance is never going to compete with high-intensity workouts when it comes to physical fitness gains, but its ==popularity== is likely to ==keep on== rising because it’s such a fun way to keep fit.
